Foosball Tracker
----------------

This project was started to have so that the [Magoosh](http://magoosh.com)/[EasyESI](http://easyesi.com) office could have an app to track their Foosball games.

It uses the [trueskill algorithm](http://github.com/saulabs/trueskill) to provide accurate rankings for players and chart them over time.

Setting it up for own office is easy, just deploy to heroku (or your favorite Rails host).
